I am a sociologist specializing in contentious politics, computational sociology, and Middle East politics, with a particular focus on social movements and state-society relations. As a Ph.D. candidate in Sociology at Boston College, my research examines the intricate dynamics of political mobilization, state institutions, and social change.
My current research investigates how state institutions interact with civil society organizations, particularly in the context of political mobilization. My work, published in leading journals such as _Comparative Political Studies_, combines rigorous empirical analysis with innovative methodological approaches to understand complex social and political phenomena.
My academic journey spans multiple institutions and cultures, from Tehran University to Boston College, giving me a unique perspective on global social movements and political dynamics. This international background enriches my approach to research and teaching, where I emphasize both theoretical depth and methodological rigor.
In the classroom, I have served as a teaching fellow for Introduction to Sociology and as a teaching assistant for various courses, including Statistics and Healthcare Sociology. These experiences reflect my commitment to nurturing critical thinking and analytical skills in the next generation of social scientists.
My research has been recognized through various fellowships and awards, including the Graduate Fellowship at the Clough Center for Constitutional Democracy and the Ivan Brown Research Grant. I am also actively involved in academic service as a referee for Comparative Political Studies and the Digest of Middle East Studies.
