# From Fields to Streets: Oil Industry and Petro Protests

## Overview
What mechanisms within the oil sector give rise to collective mobilization, and how do governance structures and civil society engagement shape these dynamics? This dissertation introduces the concept of "petro protests" to explore how systemic grievances, executive corruption, and civil society engagement influence protests related to the oil sector.

## Research Design
Drawing on original cross-national data from 2005–2019 and fixed-effects negative binomial and zero-inflated regression models, this study examines how institutional arrangements—particularly executive corruption and ownership structures—mediate the relationship between oil sector presence and collective action.

## Key Findings
- Executive corruption amplifies the protest-inducing effects of oil sector facilities, particularly under National Oil Companies (NOCs), where public expectations of accountability are higher
- International Oil Companies (IOCs) operating under stricter transparency standards exhibit weaker links to protest dynamics
- Civil society engagement moderates these effects: higher consultation reduces protest likelihood, while lower repression intensifies it

## Theoretical Framework
The study combines three interconnected theories:
1. **Grievance-based Theory**: Examines how inequitable oil wealth distribution fuels collective discontent
2. **Social Threat Theory**: Explains how perceived threats can catalyze protests
3. **Moral Economy**: Shows how violations of public expectations regarding fair resource distribution can escalate into collective action

## Active Research: Iraq Case Study
Currently conducting survey research in Iraq examining:
- Public perceptions of oil sector governance
- Patterns of protest participation
- Views on resource distribution
- Civil society engagement

## Research Contributions
This research advances our understanding of contentious politics in several key ways:
1. Demonstrates how institutional configurations moderate the relationship between resource wealth and collective action
2. Identifies mechanisms through which corruption and ownership structures shape mobilization
3. Provides new empirical foundations for analyzing state-society relations in oil-producing countries
4. Develops first systematic cross-national dataset on petro protests

## Data and Methods
- Original cross-national dataset (2005-2019)
- Fixed-effects negative binomial regression
- Zero-inflated regression models
- Survey research in Iraq
- Comprehensive analysis of oil sector facilities
